##Originally created by Sean Bennett at the Univ. of Washington

## Changelog:
## - 1-29-2016
## - Rearranged output dataframe to have CQ values all appended to the end
## - Added in column naming functionality for newly created CQ columns

## Function CQagg takes arguments dataframe (data construct containing your data), 
## label.column(column index containing sample label (std1, unkn-1, etc)), and cq.column(column where cq values are located).
## A True/False flag filename allows user to chose either outputting to a .csv file, requesting the filename wanted,
## or just a generic return of the data frame.

## NOTES ##
## Current iteration does not test for/remove NaNs, it just transfers them over as they come. Can likely be added in to
## convert them to NAs if you like. The standard curves produce a large number of NAs in columns that correspond to the
## 3rd+ replicate of the experimentals. If that's an issue, I can probably coerce a ragged array 
## (array that does not have constant length in a dimension) but I don't know how that would output.
